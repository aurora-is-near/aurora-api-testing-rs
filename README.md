# Aurora-APIs-Testing-rs
This repo implements a Rust client for Aurora Relayer APIs testing. It fetches 
test data generated by [relayer test data generator](https://github.com/aurora-is-near/relayer-test-data-generator), then it
wraps it up into multiple test runs. These test runs are used to 
be re-executed against the target RPC endpoint (for example: AURORA testnet, or mainnet).


## Prerequisites
- Rust
- Cargo

Refer to this [official installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for more information.

Before you use this repo, you must configure the following environment variables
```bash
RPC_URL="mainnet.aurora.dev:443/"

```
The `AURORA_PLUS_API_KEY` is needed to execute some special test cases. If you don't have
one, please create a new account on [Aurora+](https://aurora.plus/).
